CAMx.102108.ASOA.3D - most up-to-date run as of November, 2008.  This is the base-case.  It does not include Lea's toluene yields, Scott's deltaH parameterizations, or anything with nitrate radicals.  It is capable of making multiple layer output files though.

CAMx.122308.ASOA.3D.2 - is the same as the one before but it includes a comment in chemdriv.f to output the layer number so I can time how long the aerosol module is taking.

CAMx.NOAGE.022609 - Density is corrected in SOAP module. ALL (POA, OPOA, ASOA, BSOA) aging is turned off by setting rxn rates themselves to 0.

wetdep1.f - Version accompanying SAPRC, Gaydos code
wetdep2.f - Version with Vlassis and alexandra code

trap_SAPRC.f - Default version of trap capmatible with PSSA solveing of NO3 radicals
trap_NO3.f  - new version of trap (Vlassis KARYDIS) which calls new radslvr subroutine correctly and implements OH concentration reporting


CAMx.032009.ASOA.Rads.1 - ASOA aging, NO3 Hertel Chemistry, Radical Conc Output, Newest Hvap parameters (3-20-09)

CAMx.041009.allage - ASOA and BSOA aging, NO3 QSSA Chemistry, Radical Conc Output, Newest Hvap params, New Density Treatment

Budget Analysis
CAMx.Budget.Base.063009 - Only Functionalized OA, Base-case. No BSOA aging
CAMx.Budget.FUNC1.063009 - Same as Base-Case but with new fragmentation option for aging. Frag is set to 0 so that
			   I can compare with the base-case and make sure code is working correctly.
CAMx.Budget.P07S05.063009 - First sensitivity case. FUNC(POA) = 0.7; FRAG(POA) = 0.3
						    FUNC(SOA) = 0.5; FRAG(SOA) = 0.5


=================
PSAT
PMCAMx_PSAT_EUROPE_RDCLAY - Take away top 4 layers because pressure is too low
PMCAMx_PSAT_EUROPE_woNOx - Take away NOy family from the PSAT treatment since
    they weren't acting very stable (finally ran with this modeification in place).
PMCAMx_PSAT_EUROPE_SECTOR - Panos (university of Aegean) made source-resolved 
    emissions files that are in text format. The CAMx emissions reading routines
    and the PSAT emissions assignment routines need to be modified to accomodate 
    this.  (1-12-12)
